# SomeNecromancyRequired
Made during Spring Game Jam 2020, organized by LiU Game Jam.


Similar to Plants vs Zombies. \
Assemble ghouls to stop those pesky humans from breaking into your castle.

## Playing Instructions

Assemble a ghoul by adding available body parts (starting with a body) to the summoning circle by clicking on a part before clicking on the summoning circle.

When a ghoul is fully assembled, you can place it on the battlefield grid by clicking on it before clicking on a free grid slot.

A ghoul is fully assembled when the body has all possible parts attached to it, i.e. head, arms and legs for each body type except from horse bodies which don't support arms.

When you feel ready, press [SPACE] to start a human attack wave.

You can move ghouls to other free grid slots at any time through clicking.
